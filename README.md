# Amazon-Sales-Report
This is a short task to analyze the Amazon Sale Report of India. The data was downloaded from Kaggle.com [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data), and it repesents the sales in the second quarter of the year between latest March 2022 to the 1st of July 2022.

## Key findings

1- The total sales in Q2 2022 was approximately 75,000,000 INR, with an average sale value of 82,840 INR. Around 70% of the sales were fulfilled by Amazon warehouse, while the rest were fulfilled by other merchants. B2C sales accounted for more than 99% of the total sales, with less than 1% being B2B.

2- The highest sales value for the quarter was recorded on May 28, 2022, with a total of 1,165,038 INR, while the lowest sales value was recorded on April 28, 2022, with a total of 98,261 INR.

## Open question for investigation: 
Why did we observe two sharp drops in sales, the first on April 28, 2022, and the second on June 1, 2022? One possible reason could be a technical outage on those days. Another reason could be the holiday season in June, which could explain the drop in sales on June 1, 2022.
